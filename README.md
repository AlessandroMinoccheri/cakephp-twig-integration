CakePHP installation with twig integration

#Introduction
CakePHP is a great framework to develop sites but I think that an interesting way to upgrade this MVC is to integrate TWIG engine to make the writing of view files easier, faster and better.
Twig integration allows to create a set of template for your site.


When you clone this repository cakephp core and twig engine are already integrated, you just need to create your twig files because all the dependencies and configurations are already written to use Twig engine.

To learn how to write Twig files, look at this link that allowed me to create this cakephp installation:
