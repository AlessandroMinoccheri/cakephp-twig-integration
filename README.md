CakePHP installation with twig integration

#Introduction
CakePHP is a great framework to develop sites but I think that an interesting way to upgrade this MVC is to integrate TWIG engine to make easier, faster and better writing view file.
With twig integration is possible to create a set of template for yor site.

When you clone this repository is possible to have all cakephp core and twig engine already integrated, is sufficint to create your twig file.
Every dependencies or configuration is already done to use Twig.

To understand how write Twig file you can see this link that allowed me to create this installation of cakephp:
